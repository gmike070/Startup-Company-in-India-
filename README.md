Using Python to analysis Startup companies in India Ecosystem
## Excited to share my latest project!
I recently conducted a data analysis on startup companies in India using Python. The analysis revealed some fascinating insights, and I've created some compelling visualizations to showcase the findings.

## Analyzing the growth of Indian startups Problem statement:
1.	How the ecosystem has changed with time
2.	How the numbers of startup have increased
3.	The support and funding option that is available
‚úÖ The dataset comprises 3000 observations and 10 attribute
‚úÖ## Setting up the environment
Installing the required libraries
We need Numpy for mathematical operation
Pandas for Dataframe Manipulation
Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization
And finally Jupyter Notebook to build an interactive ipython notebook

‚úÖ## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting or removing the corrupt or inaccurate records for a record set, dataframe, database and refers to identifying the incomplete, incorrect and inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying and deleting the dirty or coarse data.
Again, Data cleaning is crucial and emphasized because wrong data can drive a business to wrong decisions, conclusion and pool analysis especially if the huge quantities of big data are into the picture.

üß† ANALYZING THE GROWTH OF INDIAN STARTUPS
üîç ANALYSIS OBJECTIVES:
1. How the ecosystem has changed with time
We‚Äôll track how industries, cities, and sectors have evolved over the years.
2. How the number of startups has increased
We'll calculate startups founded or funded per year.
3. The support and funding options that are available
We'll identify top investors, investment types, and funding trends.

üßæ Overall Conclusion
The data reflects a vibrant and rapidly evolving startup ecosystem in India, driven by both private and public funding. With increased urban-rural connectivity, digital penetration, and global investor interest, India is on track to becoming a global innovation powerhouse.
To maintain this momentum:
‚Ä¢	Strategic funding, regional inclusion, and sector-specific mentoring are crucial.
‚Ä¢	Government bodies, educational institutions, and investors should collaborate to build a sustainable and inclusive startup culture.
